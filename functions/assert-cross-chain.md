# EcoBridge

The EcoBridge is a function to interact with assets and data between external blockchains and Ecoball blockchains, allowing users to transfer assets between EVM compatible chains, improving scalability and interoperability.

EcoBridge currently supports cross-chain from Binance Smart Chain to Ecoball. Support for Binance Smart Chain and other chains will be live soon.

Below is a workflow chart of Binance Smart Chain crosses chain to the Ecoball chain:

7\. If you need to confirm asset transfer, a confirmation dialog box is displayed, as shown in the following:

8\. After confirming the Token transfer, MetaMask wallet will be called again for authorization, as shown below:

9\. After authorization, the system immediately transfers the cross-chain assets, which needs to wait for the confirmation of several blocks. Depending on the network condition, it generally takes several minutes, as shown in the figure below：

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

After sufficient block confirmations, the tokens on the original chain are converted into tokens on the target chain.
