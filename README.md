# Overview

Ecoball is a fast, decentralized blockchain system running on an improved PoS mechanism called Voting Proof of Stake (VPoS). Assets, smart contracts, NFTs from most mainstream blockchains could be unloaded and offloaded from Ecoball via secure cross-chain bridges, while Ecoball provides secure, smooth, fast and low-cost on-chain transactions.
