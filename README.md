# About Ecoball

Welcome, pioneers.

Blockchain was first applied in the Bitcoin system, and the term 'blockchain' was officially defined later in the development process.&#x20;

Blockchain is a comprehensive application model consist of technologies such as distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism and encryption algorithm, etc. This combination of technologies gives blockchain the characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof, openness, transparency and joint maintenance.&#x20;

Because of its characteristic, pioneers realize blockchain can help in solving the trust issue between people and relieve people from the privacy concern caused by internet giants.

Thereafter, numerous attempts has been made on bringing blockchain to real life by building Dapps.

However, after years of development, Dapps are not yet been massively adopted. And the major reason is that the current Dapps are built on blockchains that are incapable of processing large scale transactions.

In this context, the Ecoball chain came into being.
