# Introduction

Ecoball is an advanced blockchain developed with innovations. With 5 years of consistent research and development, Ecoball is now ready to support a large ecosystem, and its foundation is built with a sustainable economic model and a community-driven governance model. Such integration makes Ecoball a true decentralization particularly suitable for demanding Dapps in DeFi, NFT, DAO etc.

### Ecosystem

The Ecoball ecosystem is designed with a composition of the Dapp operating system, the ECO tokenomics model, the community autonomy model, and the network cloud system. The formula  makes Ecoball a powerful engine for applications, Dapps' usability gets improved to the next dimension, mass adoption becomes real.

### Features

**Vote Proof of Stake**

Vote Proof of Stake (VPOS) extends the POS model to allow individuals to stake tokens on potential validators (candidates). Candidates who collect most tokens have greater opportunities of being elected to be validators. Once blocks are successfully created, rewards will be shared by the validators and the staking entities (Voters).

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**

DAO is a smart contract algorithm. All financial transactions, rules, and decisions are enacted and stored on the blockchain, creating a transparent and verifiable record. Rules are initially set forth in smart contracts, and members (participating token holders) act according to the rules to further the goals of the organization.

**Low processing fee and high TPS**

The VPoSDAO (VPS+DAO) model verifies transactions and confirms transactions with high speed, low cost and high efficiency. Compared with the expensive gas fee of Ethereum, the gas fee of Ecoball is almost negligible, meanwhile TPS can go over 100,000.

**High security and scalability**

The VPoSDAO algorithm helps to prevent various attacks.  Excellent low-level technical architecture design, with strong scalability, easy to build upper-level applications. Find out the how-so details in the technical document.

**Native support for cross-chain protocols**

Native cross-chain mechanism is supported and it is committed to connect all assets in the blockchain, making a vision that everyone can enjoy a free, efficient and smooth transaction experience.

**Compatible with Ethereum and ecological Applications**

EcoBall is fully compatible with the Ethereum EVM. It supports Solidity to write smart contracts, the issuance of digital assets, various DeFi applications, and can seamlessly migrate EVM-compatible DeFi applications to the Ecoball chain.

**Collaborative smart contract technology**

Ecoball smart contract SDK modularization and smart contract formal verification technologies greatly reduce the threshold for developers. Meanwhile Ecoball provide solutions on tokenomics, domain name services, distributed storage services, etc.

**Multi-layer architecture **

Ecoball's architecture includes a core layer, an adaptation layer, and a business layer. The core layer encapsulates basic components of encryption and decryption algorithm, account address management, P2P network components, consensus mechanism libraries, state machines, virtual machines, etc. ; the adaptation layer provides APIs, Dapps use the API to obtain Ecoball blockchain services; the business layer provides a Dapp development platform for quick Dapp development.

**Validators**

A validator runs a node that verifies transactions and finalizes blocks on the Ecoball chain. Each validator must provide the minimum ECO collateral (500K ECO) into their pool and setup a functional node to participate. They start as candidates, and have the chance to become validators each 24h when a new validator set is chosen.

**Developers / Business Owners**

Developers can build applications on Ecoball, including industrial applications and DeFi applications. Applications that support EVM can be migrated smoothly, expanding their application scope and user groups. For migration details, please refer to the developer documentation.

**Voters**

A voter is an ECO holder who stakes ECO in a validator candidates pool. If that candidate gets elected to be a validator, the delegators will share pool rewards. By staking ECO, voters vote on their best interest, and the minimal amount to vote is 1000 ECO.
