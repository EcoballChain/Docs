# Ecosystem

The Ecoball ecosystem is composited with multiples systems like the Dapp operating system, the ECO tokenomics model, the community autonomy model and the network cloud system. The formula makes Ecoball a powerful engine for applications, Dapps' usability gets improved to the next dimension, mass adoption is made possible.

### On-chain applications

#### Decentralized Exchange (DEX) <a href="decentralized-exchange-dex" id="decentralized-exchange-dex"></a>

Today, most decentralized exchanges run on Ethereum, and they are limited by the congestion, low concurrency, and high gas fees. The DEX user experience is somewhat unsatisfying. Ecoball uses a flexible and elastically consensus mechanism to allow developers to build an efficient DEX with fast transaction speed and low transaction fees. For example, the Ecoball built-on DEX Exabc.xyz uses optimization algorithms to reduce the problem of impermanence.

#### Mortgage loan <a href="mortgage-loan" id="mortgage-loan"></a>

In DeFi space, a model of mortgage has emerged: cryptocurrency mortgage. If users want to borrow 100 US dollars, they shall transfer at least 150 US dollars worth of cryptocurrency to the platform to lock, after which the system will automatically release the funds. Compared with the traditional mortgage loan model, digital currency mortgage has unique advantages in terms of operating costs.

Traditionally, to mortgage a house, the agency needs to verify the house ownership and evaluate the property value. If the borrower defaults, the agency will bear the costs of manpower and time to auction the property. The same is true for other mortgages.&#x20;

As in a cryptocurrency lending platform, when a cryptocurrency worth of $150 is about to fall below $100, the platform will sell the cryptocurrency to not lose money. This model is considered risk-free.

However, these cryptocurrency mortgage lending platforms, like traditional mortgage lending, also rely on interest to make money. At present, the annualized interest rate of this industry is about 10%, and the rate of return is quite attractive.

#### Decentralized insurance <a href="decentralized-insurance" id="decentralized-insurance"></a>

The DeFi platform mainly provides decentralized insurance services in the two forms of mutual insurance and financial derivatives. It is an insurance agreement based on smart contracts that cannot be tampered with and is enforced automatically. It mainly targets common risk events in the token circle (including private keys Theft, exchanges are attacked, wallets are stolen, smart contracts have vulnerabilities and are manipulated) to provide risk protection.

#### Algorithmic stablecoin <a href="algorithmic-stablecoin" id="algorithmic-stablecoin"></a>

Algorithmic stable currency is also called unsecured stable currency. It has no collateral and directly issues token through a smart contract imitating the central bank. Issuers claim that the stable currency issued is worth 1 U.S. dollar, so that the market has an expected price for this. When the currency price rises, through additional issuance, the price drops to 1 U.S. dollar. When the price of the currency fell, the supply of stablecoins was recovered through the issuance of "bonds", and the price rose to $1.

#### Non-Fungible Token(NFT) <a href="non-fungible-token-nft" id="non-fungible-token-nft"></a>

Non-Fungible Token NFT (Non-Fungible Token) has the characteristics of indivisible, irreplaceable, and unique. It provides a way to mark the ownership of native digital assets (that is, assets that exist in the digital world or originate from the digital world). ). The ownership can exist outside the centralized service or centralized library. The non-Fungible and inseparable nature of NFT makes it possible to bind to some commodities in the real world and issue digital assets on the blockchain. This asset can be game items, digital artwork, identity certificates, Tickets, domain names, etc..These tokens are unique and non-copyable. Since NFT has natural collection attributes and is convenient for trading, crypto artists can use NFT to create unique digital artworks.

#### Distributed Computing and Storage <a href="distributed-computing-and-storage" id="distributed-computing-and-storage"></a>

The distributed computing and storage market is large, and the computing, transmission and storage of massive amounts of data is huge rigid market demand. According to the "Data Age 2025" released by the International Data Corporation (IDC), the global annual data will increase from 33ZB (1ZB=10 trillion bytes) in 2018 to 175ZB, which is equivalent to 491EB (1EB=1.1529) per day. e+18 bytes) data.

EcoBall Distributed Computing Storage System (EcoBall File System, EcoFS), is a decentralized P2P distributed file system by technical architecture, it is the next generation of distributed shared blockchain storage system evolved from IPFS and FileCoin; As for the economic model is concerned, EcoFS is a shared distributed cloud platform and economy. It is composed and owned by every user. Just like the arrival of the Internet and 5G, more and more data is generated by individuals, allowing users to become the main body of the sharing economy. EcoBall incentive mechanism and the dual engine of the cloud service platform allows users to enjoy consumer applications and contribute incentive dividends in the blockchain era.

EcoFS, with its technological leadership and applicability, can shoulder the important task of blockchain distributed storage technology standards and product ecological builders.

## How to join the Ecoball ecosystem? <a href="how-to-join-the-ecoball-ecosystem" id="how-to-join-the-ecoball-ecosystem"></a>

**Validators**

A validator runs a node that verifies transactions and finalizes blocks on the Ecoball chain. Each validator must provide a minimum ECO collateral of 500K to setup a node. They start as candidates, and have the chance to become validators every 24 hours in a new round of election.

**Developers / Business Owners**

Developers can build applications on Ecoball, including industrial applications and DeFi applications. Applications that support EVM can be migrated smoothly, expanding their application scope and user groups. For migration details, please refer to the developer documentation.

**Voters**

ECO holders are voters. When a voter stakes ECO in a validator / candidate pool. If the validator / candidate gets elected to be a validator in the next round, the voter will share pool rewards. By staking ECO, voters vote on their best interests, and the minimal amount to vote is 1000 ECO.
