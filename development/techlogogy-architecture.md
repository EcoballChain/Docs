Voting & Staking & Validation

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization\(DAO\) <a id="decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao"></a>

DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\). It is designed to provide a decentralized, fair, and energy efficient consensus for public chains. The algorithm works as a set of smart contracts written in Solidity.

## Voting Proof of Rights and Interests \(VOPS\) <a id="voting-proof-of-rights-and-interests-vops"></a>

Voting Proof of Stake \(VPOS\) verifies transaction generation blocks, improves transaction verification efficiency, shortens block generation time, and improves overall TPS. In response to the problems of the VPoS consensus mechanism, special optimization and treatment have been carried out to avoid behaviors that damage the system.

## Smart contract platform <a id="smart-contract-platform"></a>

Smart contracts are codes that automatically process business logic on the blockchain, which can effectively reduce the cost of trust in business transactions, help promote the establishment and development of a new generation of business models, and provide important technical guarantees for people to enter the intelligent era. The smart contract of the EcoBall blockchain is fully compatible with Ethereum, and the smart contract code written for Ethereum can be easily transplanted.

## DAPP development platform <a id="dapp-development-platform"></a>

As a decentralized application platform, the EcoBall blockchain can carry a large number of decentralized applications, including the currently popular Decentralized Finance \(Defi\). EcoBall provides developers with a variety of programming interfaces to develop DAPP, including RESTful API and SDK for various major programming languages.

## Across-chain bridge <a id="across-chain-bridge"></a>

Cross-chain bridge can realize the transfer and exchange of different blockchain assets, greatly accelerate the circulation scope and velocity of digital assets, and effectively promote the prosperity and prosperity of blockchain ecology. Cross-chain bridge is an important infrastructure in the age of value Internet. EcoBall blockchain has a built-in cross-chain bridge, which assumes the important responsibility of cross-chain operation.
